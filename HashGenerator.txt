This application is designed for Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11
and allows you to handle file hashing.

The following hash types are supported:

CRC16
CRC32
Haval
MD4
MD5
RipeMD128
RipeMD160
SHA1
SHA256
SHA384
SHA512
Tiger

CRC16 and CRC32 hash algorithms implementation provided by The Indy Project.

Haval, MD4, MD5, RipeMD128, RipeMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 and Tiger hash algorithms implementation
provided by Dave Barton at City in the Sky (DCPcrypt - Delphi Cryprography Package).

[http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/cryptography.html].

The hash of a given file can be computed and for each hash type, a hash file can be generated.
The computed hash and the filed hash are compared to check if they match.
