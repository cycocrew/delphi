This application is designed for Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11
and allows you to manage contacts.

Contacts are stored per Windows User Account in a contacts book file named <Windows_User_Account>.wcb
located in %USERPROFILE%\<Windows_User_Account>\Contacts (by default). The location of contacts book
files can controlled in advanced options.

Contacts can be synced with Google Contacts Service.

Contacts can be imported/exported from/to the following formats:

BlackBerry

Nokia
Outlook
Outlook (French)

Note that before importing contacts in Outlook, it may be useful to visit Phone and Modem control panel
and setup 'My Location', in order to have phone unumbers properly imported.

LDIF (.ldif), vCard (.vcf) formats are also supported for individual contacts storage (read/write).
Windows Contacts (.contact) format is also supported for individual contacts storage (read only).

The following CSV formats are supported for import and/or export.
