This application is designed for Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11
and allows you to manipulate DEF files (*.def).

DEF stands for "DEFinition".

DEF files are data files implementing the following format for each item:

Value<TAB>Description<"|">Keyword

"Value" and "Description" fields are separated by a <TAB> (tabulation)
"Description" and "Keyword" fields are separated by a <"|"> ("|" char)
"Description" and "Keyword" fields may be optional
Items prefixed with the "#" char are considered as commented

This application uses the VENDORS.DEF file for networking vendors (MA-L)
